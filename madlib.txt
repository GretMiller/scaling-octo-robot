I walk through the color jungle. I take out my clean canteen.
There's a flying parrot with a loud mouth in his mouth right in front of me in the small trees! I gaze at his grey egg.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther falls in front of my head! I snatch his bad breath.
I remember I have a packet of seeds that makes go into a deep slumber!
I play it away in front of the building.

Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
